This script file is to generate three output files: 
a. BOXPA/NCProviderListxxxx.csv (providers' information for mothers), 
b. BOXPA/NCMotherlistxxxx.csv (kids' names and parents' names), 
c. PA/NC_Mother_Unique_Namesxxx.csv (a list containing non-duplicated mothers' information).

The required input files are:  
echocon_xx.sas7bdat (consenting indicators for kids), 
echoconpv_xx.sas7bdat (kids and mothers' names), 
bid.csv (bid-sid crosswalk list),
and the previous batch of output files.

To proceed, please copy allsubinsur.csv, echocon_xx.sas7bdat, echoconpv_xx.sas7bdat, bid.csv, and 
previous batch of output files into the same folder you are working at.
