[Folder 1-- Children information processing](https://github.com/PSU-DA/Echo_project/tree/master/Processing_Children)

[Folder 2-- Mothers information processing](https://github.com/PSU-DA/Echo_project/tree/master/Processing_Mothers)

In this repository, each folder contains an R script file for processing chilren or mothers' information. It is recommended that each script file is put in a separate folder to avoid unnecessary interuption caused by similar or dupulicated file names created by the program. 

Every three or four weeks, we receive regularly updated files from the UNC sharing folder. Among those, "echocon_xx.sas7bdat" contains several consenting indicators for kids, "echoconpv_xx.sas7bdat" has information of kids and mothers' names, and "P1_HealthCare_10_16_2018.csv" holds mothers' provider information. We need to use these files to (1) link the mothers and babies and get their names; (2) get the consenting status for mothers and kids separately; (3) find all possible providers for mothers and babies.
