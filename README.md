Folder 1-- Children information processing

Folder 2-- Mothers information processing

In this repository, each folder contains an R script file for processing chilren or mothers' information. It is recommended that each script file is put in a separate folder to avoid unnecessary interuption caused by similar or dupulicated file names created by the program. 

Every three or four weeks, we will receive three lists from UNC sharing folder   including consenting status, provider information, id/name, etcintervention justsetting up this this program is to caputre the correct names of monthers who consented to the medical records release and link them to a list of providers.
