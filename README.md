[Folder 1-- Children information processing](https://github.com/PSU-DA/Echo_project/tree/master/Processing_Children)

[Folder 2-- Mothers information processing](https://github.com/PSU-DA/Echo_project/tree/master/Processing_Mothers)

Brief Summary

In this repository, each folder contains an R script file for processing chilren or mothers' information. If you wanted to rerun the codes, it is recommended to place each script file in a separate folder to avoid unnecessary interuption caused by similar or dupulicated file names created by the program. 

Every three or four weeks, we receive regularly updated files from the UNC sharing folder. Among those, "echocon_xx.sas7bdat" contains several consenting indicators for kids, "echoconpv_xx.sas7bdat" has information of kids and mothers' names, and "P1_HealthCare_10_16_2018.csv" holds mothers' provider information. We need to use these files to (1) get the consenting status for mothers and kids separately; (2) allocate all possible providers to mothers and babies. Please see the readme file in each folder for details.
